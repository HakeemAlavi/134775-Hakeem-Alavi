This is my final year project, named AI-DRIVEN CHOLERA WEB-BASED APPLICATION. This repository contains features such as the project's code, the documentation, the database sql file, and application screenshots. The documentation contains a developer manual that will aid in the local setup of the project on your machine. Post-setup, access the application's landing page using a link like this: "http://localhost/IS_II_Git/landing.php", and you are ready to go!
