## **Conclusion**

It is clear that all three models perform relatively similarly, with Model 3 (Logistic Regression 2) showing a slightly higher accuracy and Kappa value compared to the other models. Additionally, Model 3 exhibits balanced sensitivity and specificity, which suggests it is capable of effectively classifying both positive and negative cases. Therefore, based on these results, Model 3 was used for the classification task.
